<h1>The Three Best Movies According to Matt</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A hard hitting story with a thrilling ending mixing revenga and joy.</p>

<h3>Grose Pointe Blank</h3>
<p>Offbeat romantic comedy set in a small town, with great lead performance by John Cusack and many quotable moments.</p>

<h3>Reservoir Dogs</h3>
<p>The film that started the 90s indie film revolution? Crackling dialogue and almost cartoonish violence. Still Tarantino's best film, in my opinion.</p>
